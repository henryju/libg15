libg15 (2017-07-07)
===================
g15tools and gnome15 projects seems dead.
I needed to fix some bugs into that library, so here is another fork.
First bug fixed is described into commit 76f3592e66383cc6b551ca11428399ca06c1b646.

 * based on libg15-gnome15-1.3.0.3
 * git project renamed back to libg15
 * original NEWS file form libg15-gnome15 can be found into doc/NEWS.old
